# Aladar
Aladar is a diep.io userscript that allows you to see your allies wia [aladarServer](https://github.com/ClintFlames/aladarServer).



## How it works
Clients connect to `aladarServer` using special code. The server synchronizes player positions between connected users. So yes, you will only see people who also use it.
